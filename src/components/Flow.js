      <h2>Social Flow</h2>
      <p>
        There was supposed to be a social flow here, but for now this will be
        the only content filling upp this available space. Kind of sad if you
        ask me, but this will suffice for the moment. We had an idea of having
        like image containers that witheld the shared image/s and also the
        comment section and like/dislike button. Right now we dont have that and
        won't be able to provide a "social media flow", but you should come back
        later. Maybe it's ready by then?
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Flow;

// just add in some hardcoded images here for the flow to work
// and also add a picture container, that holds the comment, like/dislike and then i think we are done
